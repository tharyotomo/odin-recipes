        <li>200g soybean sprouts, blanched</li>

        <li>4 hard-boiled eggs, cut into quarters</li>
        <li>4 small cucumbers, sliced</li>
        <li>300g firm tofu</li>
        <li>300g tempeh</li>
        <li>2 potatoes, boiled and diced (optional)</li>
        <li>Lontong or rice cake (optional)</li>
        <li>Krupuk or emping (crackers, optional)</li>
        <li>300g peanuts (no salt)</li>
        <li>5 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
        <li>2 red chillies, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>60g palm sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tamarind extract</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lime</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Blanch all vegetables: briefly immerse them in boiling water, so that they don’t get fully cooked: let them boil for a few moments, bring them out with a foamer and pass them right away by cold water.</li>
        <li>Prepare the sauce by frying the peanuts in a hot pan with a tablespoon of oil. Stir frequently for a few minutes, until slightly brown.</li>
        <li>Mix peanuts, garlic and chilli with a mortar for a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>In a saucepan, combine the processed mixture with tamarind extract, lemon juice and water (about 50 ml). Continue simmering to achieve the desired consistency, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Cut the tofu into 2 cm cubes. Fry the tofu in a frying pan with hot oil to lightly brown on all sides.</li>
        <li>Cut the tempeh and fry for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Place all ingredients in a dish and serve with the peanut sauce on top.</li>
    </ol>
